# StreetView_ImageClassification
Personal project using SAS software. This is not an official SAS demo.

## Intruduction

### Objective
This project has the objective of building an image classifier capable of distinguishing between pictures of houses taken in place and screenshots of street view.

### Why?
In some contexts this could be considered as fraud. For example in the context of contractors whose job is to visit houses, they might be requested to provide pictures of the facade of the house as proof of visit. However, it has been detected that some people use screenshots from Google Street View to provide false proof of visit.

### How?
Using a custom CNN architecture and specific preprocessing in SAS Viya (VDMML) to build a customized image classification model.
