# StreetView_ImageClassification
Personal project using SAS software. This is not an official SAS demo.

## Introduction

#### Objective
This project has the objective of building an image classifier capable of distinguishing between pictures of houses taken in place and screenshots of street view.

#### Why?
In some contexts this could be considered as fraud. For example in the context of contractors whose job is to visit houses, they might be requested to provide pictures of the facade of the house as proof of visit. However, it has been detected that some people use screenshots from Google Street View to provide false proof of visit.

#### How?
Using a custom CNN architecture and key specific preprocessing in SAS Viya (VDMML) to build a customized image classification model.

## Street view images
If you have ever used Street View, you know that the images are some sort of 360Â° image. This type of images are what in photography is called wide-angle. 

#### Wide-angle
If you have ever seen a GoPro picture, well those are wide-angle pictures. These type of cameras are great because they capture a lot of the surroundings into the picture, but they have a downside: they are strange to look at. Straight lines no longera appear tobe straight and the relative size of objects varies depending on distance from the center of the image. This is why Google applies a post process called "defishing" to make the images look normal again.

#### Defishing 
What this process does is essentially stretch the image in a way that the center of the image stays the same, but the edges are zoomed-in. This way, the relative sizes of objects come back to normal and straight lines are straight again. There is, however, a price to pay when doing this: because the edges are zoomed in, they have lower resolution than the center of the image. This is exactly what we are looking for to determine that the image is taken from Street View
